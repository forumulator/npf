I love to code. In all sizes, shapes and forms; from creating apps for hackathons to writing everyday scripts to make life easier. I esepecially like working on scripts/utilities that make life...easier?

I decide my language based on the project, and like discovering fresh ones. Currently I'm exploring Rust and Go. Historically I've been good at C++, Java and Python and passable at Javascript.

After discovering how much fun speaking at conferences really is, I take every opportunity to present demo based talks on cloud deployments and workflows. Email me if you want me to speak at your conference.

Professionally, I program for Google. I go by the handle `gcc42` at most places. Say Hi at `pranjal at prag.io` if you want to discuss a project or a collaboration opportunity, I welcome new connections.
